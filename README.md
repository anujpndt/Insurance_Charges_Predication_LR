## Machine Learning Projects
# Project 1 :-
The decision tree model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to heart health, and it provides predictions to help medical professionals make informed decisions about potential heart conditions in patients. The repository includes code, documentation, and datasets necessary to replicate and extend the project.The decision tree model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to heart health, and it provides predictions to help medical professionals make informed decisions about potential heart conditions in patients.

# Project 3 :- 
This GitHub project implements a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate insurance charges based on relevant features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc. Linear Regression is employed to create a model that can analyze the relationships between these factors and predict insurance charges accurately. The dataset used for training and testing the model is cleaned, preprocessed, and then utilized to train the Linear Regression model. Evaluation metrics are included to assess the model's performance and help users understand the Model accuracy and reliability. This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of predictive modeling in the insurance domain.
