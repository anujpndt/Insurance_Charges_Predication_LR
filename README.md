# Project 2 :-  Insurance Charges Predictions(Linear Regression)
This GitHub project implements a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate insurance charges based on relevant features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc. Linear Regression is employed to create a model that can analyze the relationships between these factors and predict insurance charges accurately. The dataset used for training and testing the model is cleaned, preprocessed, and then utilized to train the Linear Regression model. Evaluation metrics are included to assess the model's performance and help users understand the Model accuracy and reliability. This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of predictive modeling in the insurance domain.
# Project 3 :- Taxi Fare Predictions (Random Forest)
This GitHub project focuses on predicting taxi fares using a Random Forest algorithm. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates taxi fares based on various input features such as distance, time, location, and other relevant parameters. Random Forest, a popular machine learning technique, is employed to create an accurate and efficient prediction model. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and a demonstration of how to use the trained model for fare predictions. The code and relevant documentation are provided to facilitate understanding and implementation for interested developers and data scientists.
# Project 4 :- Class Predication (Logistic Regression) 
This GitHub project focuses on utilizing logistic regression techniques on the Edu-Dataset dataset. The Edu-Dataset contains educational data that can be analyzed to predict specific outcomes or patterns using logistic regression. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can effectively classify or forecast relevant educational outcomes based on the given dataset. The implementation involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and providing insights into the educational domain using logistic regression. The project encourages collaboration, experimentation, and further enhancements to improve the predictive accuracy and understanding of educational factors impacting outcomes.
